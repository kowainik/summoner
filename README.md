Summoner is a tool for scaffolding fully configured batteries-included production-level Haskell projects.

Do you want to create a library that is to be uploaded to Hackage/Stackage, that builds with both Cabal and Stack and supports the latest three major GHC versions?
Or are you building a production application which uses a custom prelude and has CI with  GitHub Actions or Travis Linux and AppVeyors Windows checks?
Maybe do you want to play with your idea in a single module without introducing the whole complexity of the Haskell projects?
Summoner can help you do all that with minimal effort from you - it can even upload the project to GitHub if you wish!

By the way, Summoner operates as either CLI or TUI application, so you can choose what you are more comfortable with and install only the required one.

To fully understand the power in your hands with the help of Summoner, please read this section.

Below you can see highlighted features in different categories.

### Project

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

Features related to the structure and content of the generated projects.

+ Support for Cabal and Stack build tools.
+ Ability to pick stanzas (library, executable, test-suite, benchmark).
+ Usage of [common stanza](https://vrom911.github.io/blog/common-stanzas) to reduce `.cabal` file's boilerplate.
+ Option to include an alternative prelude, if desired. The project would then
  use the [`mixins` technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskelltil/comments/9qa366/easy_way_to_replace_default_prelude_with_the/).
+ Whole Hackage-upload checklist support (exhaustive `.cabal` file, PVP versioning, GHC options, conventional meta files).
+ Support for multiple GHC versions, with thoughtful reflection on project meta, base versions (e.g. `base >= 4.9 && < 4.13`), etc.
+ Ability to create runnable Haskell scripts.
+ Different license support: MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0, ISC, None (without file).
+ Creation of the `CHANGELOG.md` file with [PVP versioning policy](https://pvp.haskell.org).

```

## Usage

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

To start `summon`ing projects nothing additional is required. However, to tweak your settings further, you can use additional configuration settings.
There are several options you can use to set particular configurations for new projects (in increasing order of priority):

1. Default configuration file (`~/.summoner.toml`).
2. Fields `user.login`, `user.name` and `user.email` from `~/.gitconfig`.
3. Explicitly specified configuration file by `--file FILENAME` option (used instead of the default one if specified).
4. Options that are stated by CLI arguments.
5. User input. It could be
    * **TUI** â€“ User data specified in the window of `summon-tui`.
    * **CLI** â€“ Interactively inputted answers during execution of the `summon` command (for the options that were not specified on previous steps).

To cut a long story short, the configuration uses [Partial Options Monoid Pattern](https://medium.com/@jonathangfischoff/the-partial-options-monoid-pattern-31914a71fc67).

### File configuration

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

Here is the list of the options that can be configured to suit your needs. If options are not specified, they are asked interactively (or some sensible defaults are used).

#### TUI new command

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

![summon new TUI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8126674/49283553-fc684e00-f4cc-11e8-8411-f173f5f19a71.png)

> **Section 1** â€“ The main section where user inputs data or changes the configurations.

> **Section 2** â€“ The structure of the project that is going to be created with the current configurations. This tree changes on-the-fly.

> **Section 3** â€“ Hints, project status, or current errors in the configurations.

> **Section 4** â€“ Useful hotkeys.

The TUI window opens with the pre-filled information received from a config file and command-line arguments. However, it's possible to change any field as per your needs.

In the screenshot you can see that you'll be given a few text fields to fill in or some checkboxes that represent boolean values of the configurations. To help you fill in the correct input, there are some â“˜ info messages in the `Status` section, which give additional details about the current field.

To help you navigate between the form fields here are the available hotkeys:

| Key                               | Action                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>Esc</kbd>                    | Abort `summoner`                                                                     |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd>                  | If input is valid go to the Confirm window                                           |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                    | Change the focus to the next active field                                            |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Change the focus to the previous active field                                        |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>                  | Enable/disable current checkbox or radio button                                      |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>    | Delete the input of the current text field                                           |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>    | Delete the input of the current text field from the cursor position to the beginning |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>    | Delete the input of the current text field from the cursor position to the end       |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>    | Move the cursor to the beginning of the current input field                          |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd>    | Move the cursor to the end of the current input field                                |
| <kbd>Up</kbd>/<kbd>Down</kbd>     | Scroll license list when focused                                                     |

Note that the form should be valid in order to be able to go to the Confirm window. If there are some errors in the input, you could see details about these errors in the `Status` section of the form.

#### TUI script command

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

See [CLI description](#cli-script-command-) of the `summon script` command.

#### TUI show command

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

These commands display the list of supported GHC versions or Licenses. Also, when the license name is specified the window with the scrollable content of the License text is shown.

### CLI

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

#### CLI new command

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

In CLI mode of operation Summoner asks about every project setting. Most of the questions contain a default value, so you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to choose the default value.
If some option is specified via a configuration file or CLI arguments, then the question is skipped and the predefined value is used.

#### CLI script command

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

This command creates minimal `cabal` or `stack` script file which allows you to save some keystrokes and eliminates the need to remember magic words for scripts.

**Cabal example:** `summon script cabal -n Main.hs` generates executable file `Main.hs` with the following content:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env cabal
{- cabal:
build-depends:
  , base ^>= 4.13.0.0
-}

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

**Stack example:** `summon script stack -n Main.hs` generates executable file `Main.hs` with the following content:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack
  --resolver lts-15.5
  script
  --package base
-}

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

#### CLI show command

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

These commands display the list of supported GHC versions, or Licenses. Also, when the license name is specified, the content of the License is outputted to the terminal.

## FAQ

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

> I want to use HTTPS remote for the created GitHub project, but it creates SSH one. How should I fix this?

We are using `hub` tool to create the projects at GitHub. It uses SSH so that you would get the remote links in the following format:

```
git@github.com:user/repo.git
```

We can not change or configure this behaviour, but there are several workarounds in case you _need_ to use HTTPS link for the remote.

1. Change the remote of the repository after its creation:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```
2. Change `hub` configurations globally. Simply run the following command:
   ```shell
   git config --global hub.protocol https
   ```
3. Alternatively, change `hub` configurations for a single session:
   ```
   export HUB_PROTOCOL="https"
   ```

<hr>

> Why some of the Stack checks on my TravisCI matrix are marked as "This job is
> allowed to fail"?

Due to the Stack problem of working with older versions of Cabal, the build can
fail with Stack for some older GHCs. We are adding these checks into
`allow_failures` section, as this is a known issue, and there is no need for the
whole build to fail because of that.

For more information about the issue and some workarounds from Stack developers,
see the following ticket:

  * [commersialhaskell/stack issue](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/4488)

## For Developers

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

If you'd like to take part in the development processes, here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Summoner is a multi-package project which has two packages inside: `summoner-cli` and `summoner-tui`. We are supporting the same functionality in both of them, so, if it's possible, you should add/change the code in both of the packages.
* Summoner uses the custom prelude [`relude`](https://github.com/kowainik/relude).
* We are using the [Kowainik style guide](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide).
* To sum up, [here is the Contributing guide](https://github.com/kowainik/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-kowainik-repositories) we use across the repositories.
* This project is contributor-friendly, so be kind to other people working on the project.

### Dependencies

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

On Linux, to build the `summoner-tui` you'll need to have `libtinfo` installed. The easiest way to get this is from your system's package manager and is usually available as the package `libtinfo-dev`.

### Build

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

To build the project you can use the following commands:

```shell=
cabal build all
```

for Cabal and

```shell=
stack build
```

for Stack.

### Test

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

Summoner uses the golden tests technique for assuring the correctness of the generated files. For this purpose, we have [the `golden` folder](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/tree/main/summoner-cli/test/golden) with two sample projects to test against.

To actually run tests you need to run:

```shell
cabal test all
```

or, if using Stack

```shell
stack test
```

### Run

[[Back to the Table of Contents] â†‘](#structure)

Building Summoner with the recommended method creates two executables: `summon` and `summon-tui`. To run the compiled executable you can use the following commands:

```shell
cabal exec summon -- SOME_COMMAND
cabal exec summon-tui -- SOME_COMMAND
```

or, if using Stack

```shell
stack exec summon -- SOME_COMMAND
stack exec summon-tui -- SOME_COMMAND
```

### Generate golden tests

To regenerate the content of all projects on disk, use the following command:

```shell
cabal run gg
```
